# SdiDesk
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/sdidesk 

This was a version of SdiDesk, a wiki-like personal notebook that I wrote in 2004, that has been ported from VB Classic to VB.NET.

At the time it felt like this was one possible future for SdiDesk. So I hired someone to do it, as I wasn't experienced with VB.NET myself.

In the event, I never took it further. I didn't really want to commit more to the Microsoft treadmill, and VB.NET seemed a hell of a lot more clunky and awkward than VB Classic, losing the main attraction of being in VB at all. 

Ultimately I decided that the future of SdiDesk was something else.

At this point in time (writing in 2023), all my experiments in wiki-like note-taking / tools for thought etc, are now focused on [Cardigan Bay](https://github.com/interstar/cardigan-bay), a Clojure based wiki-engine. Cardigan Bay is under active development, I'm using it for my own personal "digital garden" and other projects, and it has some cool features. Especially the ability to embed executable Clojure code on pages.

I have no plans to continue working with SdiDesk or this code-base, but I'm leaving it here in case there are an VB coders who are interested. If that's you, then feel free to message me. I may be able to give you some pointers / explanation of how it works (to the extent I can remember)
